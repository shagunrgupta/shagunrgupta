## Ph.D Candidate (*School of International Service, American University*)

Iâ€™m a [PhD Candidate and Adjunct Instructor](https://www.american.edu/sis/faculty/sg3537a.cfm) at the School of International Service (SIS), American University, Washington, D.C. My research focuses on public trust in local governments, with an emphasis on variation in trust in municipal governance bodies among residents of unauthorized colonies in Delhi, India. 

I use network analysis and survey methods to investigate the strength of household ties to neighborhood associations, focusing specifically on localized forms of perceived effective capacity as mechanisms that influence trust in government at the local level. 

I hold an M.Sc in Global Governance and Diplomacy from the University of Oxford, and a B.A in Political Science from Hindu College, University of Delhi.
